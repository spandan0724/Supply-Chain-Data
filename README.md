The Historical Demand and Sales dataset contains 1456 rows and 7 columns. The dataset contains timestamps, product and
location information, and quantities as features. These quantities are then influenced by some external factors such as product
launches, promotions, and regular and irregular days such as festive seasons. The dataset is then made in such a way that the
smartphones consistently outperform laptops and tablets in terms of sales volume, production levels, and inventory

The Production dataset contains 1456 rows and 6 columns. It has so many account factors like market demand volatility
patterns which are in demand, competition dynamics in the market environmental regulations compliance requirements. It also give
thought to intellectual property rights considerations. Researchers Mitra (2020)[17] and Srivastava (2015) [18] have also highlighted
these factors. Accommodations are made to solidify smartphone dominance by considering conditions along with cyclical demand
fluctuations and competition levels. when it comes to their production levels laptops come between smartphones and tablets.

The inventory dataset contains 4380 rows and 6 columns. For tracking purposes, it simulates data with timestamps along
with location identifiers and product identifiers. It takes into consideration aspects like demand fluctuations over time prevailing
conditions at a given point in time or seasonality variations due to festive seasons or technological innovations happening within the
industry sector. Geopolitical factors along with market trends and regulatory changes are also accounted for while balancing. Safety
stock levels play a role in addressing variations in demand across products. Smartphones are forefront of the market with tailored
adjustments while laptops and tablets maintain a catalogue based on underlying factors.

The Simulated Transportation dataset contains 4380 rows and 7 columns. It focuses on providing insights into logistics aspects
by detailing routes taken for transportation purposes along with information about transportation modes used (such as air transport
or road transport) starting points for shipments, with ending points (destination) shipment quantities being transported at any given
point of time or location specific expenses related to transportation. [20] Each day and route are assigned timestamps to represent
the movement of products, through transportation modes. The analysis takes into account factors like delivery choices changes in
demand and adjusted transportation expenses. The research provides insights, into the market dynamics showing that tablets maintain
their position while laptops remain significantly present. This is mainly attributed to customized adaptations, economic conditions
and competitive pressures, within the supply chain.
